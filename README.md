# DSA-in-C
To prep for SC1007 in NTU, I prepped during the holidays. This will be the code in the holidays + during the course

Update: The course is completed. The module was very fun and I have attached most of my codes here. Honestly a lot of the questions were very underwhelming, 
so instead, I have attached my practice questions which I used to prepare for the midterms and final quiz.
